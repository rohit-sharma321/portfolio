    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jaswant Kumar, a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student at Maharshi Dayanand University. With a strong interest in technology and software development, I am committed to building a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical application development. I am particularly focused on enhancing my skills in programming, data structures, and software engineering, aiming to solve real-world problems through innovative solutions.

            In addition to my coursework, I am actively exploring various programming languages and development tools to broaden my technical proficiency. I am passionate about contributing to projects that emphasize quality, efficiency, and user-centered design. Looking forward, my ambition is to pursue a career in software development where I can apply my technical knowledge and continuously grow within the industry.</p>

            <a href="loginform.html"></a>
            <P>How It Works
                The style block within the head section contains the CSS for styling.
                The HTML form layout is straightforward, with fields for username and password and a submit button styled to look clean and centered on the page.</P>
